abstract = {Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is a simple and scalable protocol for building service function chaining (SFC) on IPv6 data plane. Despite the benefits, managing the data plane of service chains in SRv6 is an error-prone task for network operators, especially in large-scale data center networks. Data plane verification is a promising approach to formally verify the operator requirements. However, the existing approaches do not fully support header modifications with a variable length header in SRv6 and network functions for the service chains. In this paper, we propose a new data plane verification approach for the service chain management. Unlike the existing works, our proposed data plane model for the verification naturally includes header modifications in SRv6 and network functions for the service chains. On the basis of the model, we develop a search-based verification technique for two fundamental network properties: network reachability and isolation of a service chain from the others. To confirm the appropriateness of the approach, we implement a data plane verifier based on the model. Using the verifier, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two case examples. Through the demonstration, we show that our approach is expressive enough to verify network properties for safely managing the service chains},

abstract = {Cloud computing is gaining significant attention and virtualized datacenters are becoming popular as a cost-effective infrastructure. The network services are transitioning from a host-centric to a data-centric model moving the data and the computational resources closer to the end users. To meet the dynamic user demands, network operators have chosen to use elastic virtual resources to implement network services over static rigid physical model. With the advent of network function virtualization (NFV), network services instances are provisioned across multiple clouds for performance and load balancing purposes. Interconnection of these instances to form a complete end-to-end network service is complex, time consuming and expensive task. Service function chaining (SFC) is a mechanism that allows various service functions to be connected to each to form a service enabling carriers to benefit from virtualized software defined infrastructure. SFC is an enabler for NFV, providing a flexible and economical alternative to today's static environment for Cloud Service providers (CSPs), Application Service Providers (ASPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This paper provides a closer look at the current SFC architecture and a survey of the recent developments in SFC including its relevance with NFV to help determine the future research directions and the standardization efforts of SFC. Finally, the paper discusses open research topics in relevance with the SFC architecture and demonstrates a need for an analytical model for the SFC architecture to achieve the optimal performance.}

OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage networking vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on heterogeneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too},

abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) has emerged as an innovative network architecture paradigm that uses IT virtualization technology to abstract the network node functions from hardware. The virtualized network services hosted on Virtual Machines (VMs) are called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). The sequence of multiple VNFs required by network operators to perform traffic steering is called a Service Function Chain (SFC). Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a complementary technology which allows programmatic control of network functions and policy-based resource management. The flexibility of SDN facilitates structuring of SFCs with minimum latency. SFC provisioning using SDN and NFV will enable implementation of next generation 5G networks and make the subscriber/operator relationship more economical and flexible. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is used to select the high-quality research studies related to dynamic provisioning of SFCs in SDN and NFV. A total of 70 studies available in the literature are analyzed. Thereafter, a layered taxonomy is proposed to classify the literature based on the parameters of optimization approaches for the provisioning of SFCs. Finally, the open research challenges for SFC deployment are identified and discussed. This paper is intended to serve as a ready reference for the research community to develop effective and efficient techniques for SFC provisioning in combined SDN/NFV networks by considering a combination of multiple factors viz. placement of VNFs, load balancing, and availability. It will surely aid Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Application Service Providers (ASPs), and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in offering reliable, scalable and high-performance services to their customers.}

abstract = {The fast growing development of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) trends and the remarkable progress of Software Defined Networking (SDN) have yielded a synergy between both, towards the provision of convergent networking solutions. Since the traditional networking principles were not designed according to the NFV principles, a work has emerged dedicated to protocol redesign among the academic fellows and the industry representatives. A typical example that has been introduced in such eco-system is the concept of network service chaining, as a composition of virtual network functions stitched together in a logically ordered fashion, to create an integral networking service that can be owned by network administrators, programmers, cloud- and telco-operators. This appoints SDN as an essential technology enabler in administering advanced traffic steering techniques, thanks to the SDN controller's capability to dynamically manage VNFs virtual connections and underlying dataplane flows. Despite the rapid progression, the strategies for traffic steering in NFV environment, are still facing imminent challenges to be addressed. This paper joins NFV and SDN technology into a novel traffic steering solution based on open source reference implementations (such as SDK for SDN, virtual Traffic Classifier, virtual Media Transcoder, and WAN Infrastructure Connection Manager) designed with performance and network optimizations in mind. We have successfully deployed and tested the system prototype in a real datacenter. The evaluation results of the prototype system: (1) validated the presented chain use cases, (2) affirmed an efficient performance and scalability of the chaining method, and (3) certified good quality of video traffic transmission and transcoding.}

This paper exploited Network Service Mesh (NSM) framework features to create a service function chain on a multi-node Kubernetes cluster. We focus on the design and implementation of SFC in Kubernetes using NSM. Also, we deployed our custom-built containers in the Kubernetes cluster to create a service function chain. Hence, we demonstrate how an SFC is designed in a cloud-native environment rather than a traditional NFV/SDN approach. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance, we compare different frameworks that support SFC in Kubernetes, highlighting the advantage and disadvantages of each framework.",

    abstract =  {This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is an inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This network reachability information includes information on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachability information traverses. This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},
